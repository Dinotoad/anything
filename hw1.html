  <p>2 Playlists, 2 Usual Moods</p>

      FOCUS
    </a>
  </h3>
  <p>The goal of FOCUS is to provide a more calming and measured energy, not focusing on lyrics
  and more so on noises that I like.</p>
  The ideal listener of this playlist is someone who is trying to focus on a task, but still would like
  some kind of background noise to listen to, but it is far from your average lofi beat playlist.
  I tried to make it where the "background noise" isn't so reductive that it literally becomes background noise,
  but more so something that you can feel emotion toward while not being too distracted.

  </a>
  <p><b>THE GOAL OF AUGH AUGH IS TO BE LOUD AND INTENSE</b>
    <br> <br>
    The ideal listener of this playlist is someone who is trying to perform some kind of intense activity,
    may that be working out, or even intensive studying. A lot of the songs on this playlist tend to be very
    aggressive featuring intense breakdowns, booming drums, and usually a lot of yelling.
